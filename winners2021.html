            <br> In 2021, published by Hazelight Studios, cooperative platform<br> adventure game
            <span class="color-text">It Takes Two</span> is designed for two players only. It follows<br> Cody and May, a couple who
             are contemplating divorce and are<br> transformed magically into dolls by the tears of their
             daughter.<br> To restore them to human form, however, they have to travel<br> through utterly
             fantastical and changing worlds, co-operating<br> with each other's special and changing powers
             in each level to<br> defeat barriers and restore their relationship. It Takes Two's<br> innovative
             co-op gameplay and emotional narrative resonated with many, <br>earning it Game of the Year at
             The Game Awards 2021. The game<br> explores connection, compromise, and love through its
             innovative<br> challenges and engaging narrative.
