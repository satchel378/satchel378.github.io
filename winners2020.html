            <br> The Last of Us Part II is an action-adventure video game created by Naughty Dog and released <br>
            only for the PlayStation 4 in June 2020. It is the sequel to The Last of Us (2013) and continues <br>
            the story set in a post-apocalyptic United States that has been ruined by a mutated Cordyceps fungus <br>
            that infects human beings and turns them into violent infected creatures. The game centers primarily <br>
            on Ellie, now an adult, on a bloody quest of revenge and self-discovery after a horribly violent and <br>
            intimate tragedy. Praised for its emotionally resonant narrative, well-developed characters, and <br>
            mature thematic discussions of such things as trauma, loss, and moral ambiguity, the game pushed the <br>
            boundaries of interactive storytelling. The Last of Us Part II received widespread critical acclaim <br>
            and took home The Game Awards 2020 Game of the Year, in addition to many other accolades including <br>
            Best Narrative, Best Direction, and Best Audio Design.
