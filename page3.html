            The Last of Us Part II is an action-adventure video game created by Naughty Dog and released 
            only for the PlayStation 4 in June 2020. It is the sequel to The Last of Us (2013) and continues 
            the story set in a post-apocalyptic United States that has been ruined by a mutated Cordyceps fungus 
            that infects human beings and turns them violent infected creatures. The game centers primarily 
            on Ellie, now an adult, on a bloody quest of revenge and self-discovery after a horribly violent and 
            intimate tragedy. Praised for its emotionally resonant narrative, well-developed characters, and 
            mature thematic discussions of such things as trauma, loss, and moral ambiguity, the game pushed the 
            boundaries of interactive storytelling. The Last of Us Part II received widespread critical acclaim 
            and took home The Game Awards 2020 Game of the Year, in addition to many other accolades including 
            Best Narrative, Best Direction, and Best Audio Design.
