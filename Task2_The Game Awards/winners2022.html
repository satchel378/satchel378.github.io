            Released in February 2022 by FromSoftware, Elden Ring is a huge<br> 
            open-world action role-playing game set in the fantasy Lands Between,<br>
            a realm once blessed by the powerful Elden Ring and ruled by Queen<br>
            Marika the Eternal. Players take on the role of a Tarnished, an exiled<br>
            warrior who is called back to this shattered world once the Elden<br>
            Ring is broken and its shards, the Great Runes, are seized by Marika's<br>
            demigod children, plunging the world into chaos. The Tarnished will<br>
            embark on a dangerous journey to retrieve the Great Runes, battle<br> 
            the demigods, and become the Elden Lord. It's famous for its challenging<br>
            combat, intricate lore, vast exploration, and player freedom. Elden Ring was<br>
            universally critically acclaimed and went on to win Game of the Year<br>
            at The Game Awards 2022.
